  "[Gucci Mane:] Tell the skinny hoes to point me where the thick hoes at He want a flat booty bitch, I'm not with all that I got chips for days, and I got whips for weeks I bring out the fleet and it bring out the freaks It's a block party they did blocked off half the street She's a big booty bitch, showing ass and cheeks She's a walking bag of money, she's a masterpiece So when she running game on ya she's an athlete Hat trick, gave three hoes three stacks a piece And every time I get that head she get that bread from me [Megan Thee Stallion:] Look, big ole ass is heavy Shake that shit like jelly Put me on yo plate and slurp that shit up like spaghetti Make that shit look easy, I ain't trying, I just be me I ain't never met a ho I felt like I had to compete with, uh This the type of booty make a nigga drop his bitch, wait This the type of ass when I get home he washing dishes, uh He wanna ride on the horse, he need to give me the keys to a Porsche I told him after you finish your dinner I cannot let you leave off of the porch Boy, let me butter your corn on the cob We give each other more neck than the bob He like to put a little oil on my ass before he record so I feel like a star, huh Rolling like I'm Tina, pussy Aquafina Make this booty giggle like you Martin and I'm Gina, hmm Put me in designer, uh, let me meet yo mama, uh If you got another bitch don't put me in no drama, ah [Gucci Mane:] Tell the skinny hoes to point me where the thick hoes at He want a flat booty bitch, I'm not with all that I got chills for days and I got wheels for weeks I bring out the fleet and it bring out the freaks It's a block party they did blocked off half the street She's a big booty bitch, showing ass and cheeks She's a walking bag of money, she's a masterpiece So when she running game on ya she's an athlete Hat trick, gave three hoes three stacks a piece And every time I get that head she get that bread from me (It's Gucci!)",
